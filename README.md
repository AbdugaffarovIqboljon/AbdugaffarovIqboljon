I am a Flutter Developer with over 2 years of experience building mobile applications. I focus on creating apps that are easy to use, fast, and work well on both Android and iOS.

Core Technical Skills:

State Management: Proficient in BLoC, Cubit, and Provider, enabling scalable and maintainable architectures.

Clean & Modular Architecture: I follow best practices to keep my code simple, organized, and easy to maintain.

Asynchronous & Reactive Programming: I use Dart’s Futures and Streams to handle data and operations smoothly.

Backend Integrations & Real-Time Communication: Extensive experience with RESTful APIs, WebRTC for real-time video/audio communications, Socket.io for live chats, and Firebase (Firestore, Realtime Database, Notifications).

Database & Offline Persistence: I work with Hive, SqfLite, and Shared Preferences to support offline data.

UI/UX and Animations: I can turn Figma designs into smooth, interactive app interfaces with effective animations.

Testing & Performance Optimization: I regularly test my apps and optimize them to ensure they run well on both Android and iOS.

I am always learning and improving my skills to build better mobile applications. My goal is to use modern Flutter tools and techniques to create apps that deliver a great user experience.
